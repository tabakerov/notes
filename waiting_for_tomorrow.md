# Waiting For Tomorrow

When I was a kid (about 10 years old), I was not very impressed about visiting a school. So to make it easier, I came up with a mental trick to make weekdays fly faster, so the weekend came earlier.

Once-in-a-year events like New Year's or Birthdays come up unexpectedly, so there was almost no waiting for them as I usually slept out of my mind. So my 'mental horizon' was around a couple of weeks.

The first thing I'd been waiting for a really long time (as far as I remember now) was S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game. My first acquaintance with this game was in a newspaper on a really early stage of development years before release. But then there were a couple of delays that shifted the release date even more to the future.

And then things started to be updated regularly. So each year there is something new and shiny among smartphones, computers and computers' parts, software, cars... So instead of enjoying things I have, I started waiting "a couple of months" for a newer something because what's here today would become obsolete soon.

And this issue isn't about some 'big things' as flagship devices, but about some little everyday things in my life. I rather wait for a new mechanical keyboard to write texts (and I have no idea about those texts) than write it with tools I have right now: old but good MacBook Pro 15" 2016, or iPad Pro with Apple Pencil. So I'm painfully browsing videos and reviews of Leopold/Vortex/Varmilo/Keychron/Drop keyboards instead of making things done with tools I already have (and to be honest, this tools are pretty enough to make these things done)

But... looks like I've managed to break this 'trap' and have written this text at least.
